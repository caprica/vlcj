vlcj
====

The vlcj project provides a Java framework to allow an instance of a native
[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc "VLC") media player to be embedded in a Java
AWT Window or Swing JFrame.

You get more than just simple bindings, you also get a higher level framework
that hides a lot of the complexities of working with LibVLC.

vlcj is primarily developed and therefore extensively tested on Linux - it does
also work just fine on Windows and MacOSX, although there may be some
limitations on OSX.

At least JDK 1.6 is required, and it works without changes on JDK 1.7+.

This is the open source vlcj project page, see also the 'official'
[home page](http://capricasoftware.co.uk/#/projects/vlcj "Official vlcj home page at Caprica Software")
where you can find more information as well as some new simple tutorials.

Version 3.0.0+ of vlcj requires version 2.1.0+ of VLC, earlier versions of VLC
are *not* supported and will *not* work.

Version 3.0.0+ of vlcj requires version 3.5.2 of JNA.

Some features of version 3.0.0+ of vlcj (such as the new audio equalizer API)
require version 2.2.0+ of VLC.

If you still need to use VLC 2.0.x then you must stay with vlcj 2.x.x instead
of upgrading to the new vlcj 3.0.0 series.

02/03/2015 vlcj-pro released, free time-limited trial packages are available from the official
[vlcj-pro](http://t.co/Gv04rAta9c) product page.

Version 3.0.0+ of vlcj requires version 2.1.0+ of vlc, earlier versions of vlc
are *not* supported and will *not* work.

Some features provided by vlcj depend on the runtime version of vlc. The most current release of
vlcj often tracks the bleeding edge of VLC development, consequently some features provided by
vlcj will require a very recent version of VLC and in some cases a pre-release version of VLC
may be needed. Where the runtime version of VLC is not new enough, in most cases vlcj attempts to
fail-safe. 

See also [vlcj-info](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj-info) for a small library that can extract
information from local media files using the MediaInfo library.
