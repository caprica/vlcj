# CONTRIBUTING

## Pull Requests

All pull requests, other then GitHub official Dependabot requests, apparently
submitted by or written by or with the assistance of AI, will be rejected with
prejudice and the offending account permanently blocked - no exceptions, no
appeals, no second chances, no reversals.

In all other cases, if you submit a pull request you are agreeing to transfer
any and all of your own copyright rights in that pull request to Caprica Software
Limited for no consideration whatsoever in return so that our ability to continue
our commercial software licensing business is not impeded in any way.

If you don't like this policy, that's fine, don't submit any contributions.
