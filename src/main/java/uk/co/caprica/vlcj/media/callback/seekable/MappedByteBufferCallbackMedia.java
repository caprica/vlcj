 * Implementation of seekable callback media that uses a {@link MappedByteBuffer}.

 * The supplied buffer is used as-is, it is the responsibility of the caller to open/close the resources associated with
 * the buffer.
 * <p>
 * Operations on a {@link MappedByteBuffer} are limited to int values by {@link MappedByteBuffer#position(int)}, whereas
 * {@link #onSeek(long)} takes a long.
 * <p>
 * That means this media can not support file sizes greater than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}.
 * <p>
 * A custom implementation could support long-based operations by encapsulating multiple {@link MappedByteBuffer}
 * instances at various offsets within the file.
