/**
 * Specification for media provided by native callbacks.
 * <p>
 * Implementations <em>are</em> allowed to block the native thread when waiting for IO - however care must be taken,
 * e.g. on error conditions, to not block indefinitely as doing so will prevent the native media player from being
 * stopped.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Implementations of this class by definition rely on the use of native callbacks that are implemented in Java
 * code - steps must be taken to prevent instances of implementation classes from being garbage collected otherwise the
 * native code will crash when the Java object disappears.</strong>
