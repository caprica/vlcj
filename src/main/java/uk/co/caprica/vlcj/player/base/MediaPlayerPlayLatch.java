/**
 * This class implements a mechanism to play a media item and wait for it to start (or wait for it to raise an error
 * instead of starting).
 * <p>
 * Ordinarily a call to play new media returns immediately and the native media player attempts to open and start
 * playing the media asynchronously. This can make it a little difficult for application code to know if the media
 * successfully started or failed to start because of an error.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for application code to respond to media player events to determine whether the media started
 * successfully or failed because of an error but this class serves as a convenient encapsulation of that functionality.
 * <p>
 * The strategy is simply to block the play call until a media player "playing" or "error" event is received.
