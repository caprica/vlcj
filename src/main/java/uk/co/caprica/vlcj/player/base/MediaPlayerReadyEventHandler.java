/**
 * Event listener implementation that waits for the first position changed event and raises a synthetic media player
 * ready event.
 * <p>
 * Some media player operations require that the media be definitively playing before they are effective and the
 * "playing" event itself does not guarantee this.
 * <p>
 * Behaviour it this:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>each time new media is set, a "media changed" event is fired;</li>
 *     <li>if media reaches the end normally, a "finished" event is fired, followed by a "stopped" event;</li>
 *     <li>if media is stopped, a "finished" event is fired, followed by a "stopped" event;</li>
 *     <li>if new media is set before the current media expires, a "media changed" event is fired but neither "finished"
 *     nor "stopped" is fired.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The net result of the above is that the "ready" event state needs to be reset on a "stopped" event, and on a "media
 * changed" event.
