/**
 * Native event manager implementation for media player events.
 * <p>
 * There is some special case handling in {@link #onCreateEvent(libvlc_instance_t, libvlc_event_t, MediaPlayer)} to deal
 * with side-effects when changing media where we invoke stop on the media list player associated with the media player
 * instance. This occurs in {@link SubitemApi#changeMedia(libvlc_media_t)} and is required for proper operation of media
 * that creates sub-items (e.g. YouTube or similar). Without this stop call, the sub-items would not play properly for
 * such media.
 * <p>
 * The side-effect is that the media player will receive a spurious  media player stopped event, before the media has
 * even started playing. This is unexpected behaviour and is likely to be confusing to client applications.
 * <p>
 * The special case handling itself suppresses this spurious media player stopped event if a playing event has not been
 * received prior. The heuristic resets each time the media changes. This issue is a specific consequence of handling
 * a change in media.
 * <p>
 * This class is the appropriate place for the implementation as this code will always be called on the native media
 * player event thread and will never be invoked in parallel oor by any other thread.
