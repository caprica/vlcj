/**
 * This class implements a mechanism to stop a media player and wait for it to stop (or wait for it to raise an error
 * instead of cleanly stopping).
 * <p>
 * Ordinarily a call to stop a media player returns immediately and the native media player will stop asynchronously.
 * This can make it a little difficult for application code to know if the media player has definitely stopped before
 * the application performs any clean-up, like releasing the media player (which might cause a crash).
 * <p>
 * It is possible for application code to respond to media player events to determine whether the media player stopped
 * definitively but this class serves as a convenient encapsulation of that functionality.
 * <p>
 * The strategy is simply to block the stop call until a media player "stopped" or "error" event is received.
