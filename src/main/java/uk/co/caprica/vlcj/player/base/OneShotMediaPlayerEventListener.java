/**
 * Base implementation for a component that supports "one-shot" event listeners, i.e. event listeners attached to a
 * media player instance that will remove themselves when an event of interest is fired.
 * <p>
 * A sub-class should override methods to implement the desired event behaviour, and from one or other of those methods
 * it should invoke {@link #done(MediaPlayer)} to cause the listener to be removed.
 * <p>
 * It is the event method implementations that decide if/when the event listener should be removed, so it may not
 * strictly be one received event only - for example if a listener were added to trigger when the playback time reached
 * five seconds, there would be multiple intermediate time changed events fired before the target time were reached.
 * <p>
 * Note that by default, the following methods will be implemented to invoke {@link #done(MediaPlayer)}, this behaviour
 * can be overriden by sub-classes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #stopped(MediaPlayer)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #error(MediaPlayer)}</li>
 * </ul>
