     * <p>
     * Ordinarily when setting the video surface the actual association of the video surface with
     * the native media player is deferred until the first time media is played.
     * <p>
     * This deferring behaviour is usually a good thing because when setting a video surface
     * component on the native media player the video surface component must be a displayable
     * component and this is often not the case during the construction and initialisation of the
     * application.
     * <p>
     * Most applications will not need to call this method.
     * <p>
     * However, in special circumstances such as associating an embedded media player with a media
     * list player, media is played through the media list rather than the media player itself so
     * the deferred association of the video surface would never happen.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method ensures that the video surface is properly associated with the native
     * media player and consequently the video surface component must be visible when this method is
     * called.
