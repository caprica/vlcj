/**
 * Implementation of a media player that renders video to an video surface embedded in the application user interface.
 * <p>
 * Note that to get mouse and keyboard events delivered via listeners on some platforms (i.e. Windows) you will likely
 * need to invoke {@link InputApi#enableMouseInputHandling(boolean)} <em>and</em>
 * {@link InputApi#enableKeyInputHandling(boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * This implementation supports the use of a heavyweight 'overlay' window that will track the video surface position and
 * size. Such an overlay could be used to paint custom graphics over the top of the video.
 * <p>
 * The overlay window should be non-opaque - support for this depends on the JVM, desktop window manager and graphics
 * device hardware and software.
 * <p>
 * The overlay also has some significant limitations, it is a component that covers the video surface component and will
 * prevent mouse and keyboard events from being processed by the video surface. Workarounds to delegate the mouse and
 * keyboard events to the underlying component may be possible but that is a responsibility of the overlay itself.
 * <p>
 * The overlay will also 'lag' the main application frame when the frame is dragged - the event used to track the frame
 * position does not fire until after the window drag operation has completed (i.e. the mouse pointer is released).
 * <p>
 * A further limitation is that the overlay will not appear when full-screen exclusive mode is used - if an overlay is
 * required in full-screen mode then the full-screen mode must be simulated (by re-sizing the main window, removing
 * decorations and so on).
 * <p>
 * If an overlay is used, then because the window is required to be non-opaque then it will appear in front of
 * <strong>all</strong> other desktop windows, including application dialog windows. For this reason, it may be
 * necessary to disable the overlay while displaying dialog boxes, or when the window is deactivated.
 * <p>
 * The overlay implementation in this class simply keeps a supplied window in sync with the video surface. It is the
 * responsibility of the client application itself to supply an appropriate overlay component.
