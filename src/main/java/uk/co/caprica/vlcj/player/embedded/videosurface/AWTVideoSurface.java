/**
 * Base implementation for a video surface that requires AWT.
 * <p>
 * This base class is used to perform the necessary bespoke initialisations for any video surface that uses an AWT
 * component (most likely a Canvas).
 * <p>
 * Presently the only bespoke initialisations are for Linux, specifically:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *       force the the libjawt shared object - without doing this, the JNA {@link Native#getComponentID(Component)} call
 *       will likely fail with an {@link UnsatisfiedLinkError};
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       invoke XInitThreads - without doing this VLC will complain about XLib not being properly initialised for
 *       threads, and some VLC plugins will fail to load, likely resulting in sub-optimal video playback or some VLC
 *       plugin functionality not being available.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * This bespoke initialisation is localised to this component since it is not required, and can cause fatal JVM issues,
 * with a JavaFX application where AWT is not used.
