/**
 * Default implementation of the media list event listener.
 * <p>
 * Simply override the methods you're interested in.
 * <p>
 * Events are <em>not</em> raised on the Swing Event Dispatch thread so if updating user interface components in
 * response to these events care must be taken to use {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)}.
 * <p>
 * Equally, care must be taken not to call back into LibVLC from the event handling thread - if an event handler needs
 * to call back into LibVLC it should use the {@link MediaPlayerFactory#submit(Runnable)} method to submit a task for
 * asynchronous execution.
