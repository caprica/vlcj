/**
 * Exception thrown if not all methods in the native library could be mapped at run-time.
 * <p>
 * When using JNA direct mapping, if any method in the implementation class declared native does not exist in the native
 * library loaded at run-time, an exception will be thrown and further because this mapping is done during class static
 * initialisation what will actually be thrown is {@link NoClassDefFoundError} exception.
 * <p>
 * This is extremely unfortunate as that exception can not, for historical reasons, have a root cause exception.
 * <p>
 * So we make the reasonable assumption when registering the direct-mapped native library that if NoClassDefFoundError
 * occurs this is the reason.
