/**
 * Factory for creating media player instances and associated components.
 * <p>
 * When using VLC options/arguments to initialise the factory, generally any options that enable/disable modules (e.g.
 * video/audio filters) must be set via the factory instance and not when invoking
 * {@link uk.co.caprica.vlcj.player.base.MediaApi#play(String, String...)}. However, the module-specific
 * options <em>may</em> be able to be passed as media options and be effective via that play call.
 * <p>
 * The factory will attempt to automatically discover the location of the required LibVLC native library, so it should
 * just work by default (at least for the most common/likely environment configurations). If you have other requirements
 * for the native library discovery mechanism, you can pass in your own implementation of {@link NativeDiscovery} when
 * you create the factory.
 * <p>
 * You should explicitly {@link #release()} the factory when your application terminates to properly clean up native
 * resources.
 * <p>
 * The factory also provides access to the native libvlc Logger and other resources such as the list of audio outputs,
 * and the list of available audio and video filters.
 * <p>
 * You <em>must</em> make sure you keep a hard reference to the components created by this factory to prevent them from
 * going out of scope and being garbage-collected. If you allow one of these components to go out of scope, then
 * unpredictable behaviour will occur (such as events no longer seeming to fire) even though the video playback may
 * continue (since that happens via native code). You will also likely suffer fatal JVM crashes.
 * <p>
 * It is <em>always</em> a better strategy to <em>reuse</em> media player instances, rather than repeatedly creating
 * and destroying them.
