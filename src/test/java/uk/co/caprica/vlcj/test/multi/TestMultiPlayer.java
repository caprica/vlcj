/**
 * Example multi-instance player.
 * <p>
 * This approach to multi-instance players is not really recommended due to potential
 * concurrency/re-entrancy problems with the long list of native libraries that vlc uses. The more
 * player instances you have in one application, the more likely you are to see fatal crashes in
 * those native libraries.
 * <p>
 * One of the biggest culprits is Fontconfig: version 2.10.91+ is supposed to be thread-safe so one
 * of the most common causes of multi-player crash bugs should be gone when compiled with that
 * particular version. However, other native libraries may still cause problems.
 * <p>
 * Also, a current limitation of vlc is that all in-process media players will share the same audio
 * controls - there is no independent audio control available.
 * <p>
 * Out of process media players are reliable, but a lot more difficult and intricate to implement.
