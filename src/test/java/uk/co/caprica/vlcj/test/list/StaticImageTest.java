/**
 * Bare bones showing how to "play" static images in a play-list.
 * <p>
 * A proper application would embed a video player and so on, the points to illustrate here are a)
 * playing an image is just like playing any other file, and b) you specify the image duration using
 * a media option.
 * <p>
 * If you do not specify an "image-duration=" media option, you will get a default length of ten
 * seconds.
 * <p>
 * You can also add for example vlc://pause:30 to "play" a delay of 30 (or whatever you want)
 * seconds. This is not to be confused with the media option for image-durations previously
 * described.
 * <p>
 * Note that you can "play" images from any source that vlc can play - not just local files, but
 * things like http: too.
 * <p>
 * Large images can cause problems for vlc when it tries to create the video output - for this
 * reason it is usually better to use an {@link EmbeddedMediaPlayer} linked with the
 * {@link MediaListPlayer}. That way the size of the video surface can be controller. If this is not
 * done, fatal application crashes due to vlc choking on the image file can occur.
