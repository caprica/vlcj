/**
 * Simple example to show how to extract the audio track from a media file and encode it as a
 * stand-alone mp3.
 * <p>
 * Specify a MRL and an mp3 output file as command-line arguments.
 * <p>
 * On Linux at least you can have a media player play the mp3 file as it is being generated.
 * <p>
 * Since no video is being displayed the audio is played back and encoded as quickly as possible.
